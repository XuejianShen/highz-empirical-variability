# Simple Empirical Model for Predictions of UV Luminosity Functions at High Redshift

The method is described in [Shen et al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230505679S/abstract).

## `model_uvlf.ipynb`
The main pipeline to generate predictions of the UV luminosity functions using the empirical model described in Shen et al. 2023. 

## `sampling.ipynb`
A Monte-Carlo sampling approach to estimate the combined variability from different physical sources

## compiled UVLF observation data
The compiled observational data is stored at `./observational_data/UVLF_DATA_COMPILED.zip`. The data format for each observation paper could be slightly different, please check the header of the data file carefully.
